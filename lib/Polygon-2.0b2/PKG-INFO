Description: 
        Polygon is a python package for easy handling of polygons in 2D. It contains
        Python bindings for gpc, the excellent General Polygon Clipping Library by
        Alan Murta and some extensions written in C and pure Python. With Polygon you
        may handle complex polygonal areas in Python in a very intuitive way. Polygons
        are simple Python objects, clipping operations are bound to standard operators
        like +, -, \|, & and ^. TriStrips can be constructed from Polygons with a
        single statement. Functions to compute the area, center point, convex hull and
        much more are included.

        The wrapping and extension code is free software, but the core gpc library is
        free for non-commercial usage only. The author says:
